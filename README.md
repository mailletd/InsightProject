# InsightProject

In this project, I created an interactive dashboard that predicts how many people will go see each Blue Jays baseball game at the Rogers center in Toronto for the year 2019 (bluejaysattendance.com).

Historical data (1978-2019) regarding the outcome of baseball games was obtained from https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/.

WinLossRatioForOtherTeams.ipynb calculates win/loss ratios for the Blue Jays and other teams in their division for the historial data.

2019_AllTeams_WinLoss.ipynb calculates win/loss ratios for 2019. 

BaseballScript.ipynb takes data from many sources and does some preprocessing on it. 

Exploratory_visualisation.ipynb explores how different variables are related to attendance. 

Modeling.ipynb implements machine learning models that predicts attendance based on historical data.
